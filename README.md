### Some Open Source Resources
Check out [@csharpfritz](https://twitter.com/csharpfritz) who runs a live coding stream on Twitch.TV. [csharpfritz on Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/csharpfritz)

Follow him, and watch his streams. Lots to learn, and he has an Open Source project you can contribute to here
[CoreWiki - https://github.com/csharpfritz/CoreWiki](https://github.com/csharpfritz/CoreWiki)

Oh, and if he gets up to 5000 followers then he will dye his beard Rainbow coloured. :)
